### Description

A 3D RPG made with PURE VB! Use the Mouse to look around, the keyboard to move! Unlimited terrain sizes! No Direct X or third-party controls. Very Fast - Tested on a P133!!! Very simple code - Anyone can understand it and every line is commented. But keep in mind this is only a draft and it will eventually be made into something much bigger. I made this in 2 hours, including the textures so please don't mind the graphics. Please download to see for yourself. And please vote!!! Thanks!
